## What is ME440?
ME440, also known as "Advanced Fluid Mechanics", is a graduate-level fluids elective course at The Cooper Union ([syllabus](ME440_syllabus.pdf)). The class builds on the required mechanical, chemical, and civil engineering fluid mechanics courses, going more in-depth with the derivations and covering additional advanced concepts. I took this course during the Fall 2021 semester (my senior year) to learn more about the field of fluid mechanics and build on my current skillset for fluid mechanics problems. The topics covered in this course were:
* Properties and Conservation Laws
* Navier-Stokes Equations
* Couette and Duct Flows
* Scaling and Nondimensionalization
* Lubrication Flow
* Unsteady Flow
* Inviscid Flow
* Bernoulli equations
* External Flow and Boundary Layers, including: "Exact" (Blasius) Solution, Pressure Gradient, Separation, Thwaiteâ€™s method 
* Turbulence, including: Transition & Stability, Governing Equations, Wall-Bounded Turbulent Flow Structure, Internal Turbulent Flows, and Free Turbulent Flows 

## What code is here?
This repo contains my work for any homework questions that required code ([HW 1](HW1) and [HW 4](HW4)). It also contains my code for the [final](Final) exam. The homework and exam folders have my code and the output figures (where applicable).

## Credits
All the code presented in this repo is my own work.
